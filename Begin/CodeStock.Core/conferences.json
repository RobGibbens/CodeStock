We will discuss the anthropological reasons why humans walk upright, and how that impacts the way we use computers (or more precisely, the way that computer use injures our bodies). Specific attention is given to how the spine and nervous system interact, creating subluxations under stress that can cause any number of issues from allergies to miscarriages. We examine how the human eye works to focus and transduce light into neural impulses, and how the visual needs demanded by computer use work to destroy this system. Common hand and wrist injuries are covered, as well as their early warning signs and ways to avoid them. Finally, we cover the phenomenon of \"screen apnea,\" where people tend to hold their breath in stressful situations (such as receiving an email or having a test fail), and discuss how this type of breathing contributes to a host of serious ailments.

Imagine being able to instrument asynchronous calls without changing a line of your existing code but with the ability to see the performance in a continuous line of active and elapsed time from the initial request. Zone can run with any JavaScript library and does not require Angular but can enhance the way you integrate third-party components with Angular.

You send a message to the server, and the server broadcasts it to everyone who's in your room. In the past, in order to build a system like that took time and code. How about dynamically refreshing content in your application based on events that happen on the server?

Learn how to create powerful, rich web interfaces using the right tools for the job while retaining server-side logic in the languages you know.","links":[],"tags":[],"subjects":[],"resources":[],"prerequisites":[],"speakers":[{"profileImageUrl":"/img/speakers/default.png","slug":"jay-harris","firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Harris","fullName":"Jay Harris"}],"speakerNames":"Jay Harris","startDescription":"Saturday 8:30 AM"},{"slug":"sniffing-out-success-identifying-smells-and-a","title":"Sniffing Out Success: Identifying Smells and Anti-Patterns in Your Code","start":"\/Date(1405153800000)\/","end":"\/Date(1405158000000)\/","room":"400b","description":"This presentation reviews some of the most common and dangerous code smells and anti-patterns supported by some debate about why they should be avoided.

The Internet of Things, IoT, is upon us in a big way and more objects are becoming embedded with sensors and gaining the ability to communicate. It is easy to use a microcontroller to collect data and send to the cloud to analyze and make new insights with the data. Our homes, businesses, and cities are all becoming smart. In this talk you will learn how to leverage your existing .net skills for the IoT and connect to the physical world! You will learn how to use C# and the .net micro framework to control Netduino microcontrollers that read sensors and control devices over the network. Additionally you will learn how to use the vision system of the Microsoft Kinect SDK in new and creative ways to control devices from both gestures and speech recognition. The Internet of Things IoT is one of the latest popular buzz phrases, but has been my passion for three years. Devices that can both sense the environment and communicate become both tools for understanding and also allow you to control it. My killer IoT Projects: Combine with the Microsoft Kinect vision system to allow gestures to control IoT devices Steer a blimp from a mobile phone Aim a squirt gun from gestures or from a phone to nail the kids swimming in the pool Control the garage door Control watering of our garden Control the lights at home from the web, audio commands or from gestures Transmit IR signals to control TV and music from a website Scare the kids at Halloween with ghost and monsters that are controlled from a mobile app and interact with the kids through the Microsoft Kinect vision system Microsoft Channel 9 Coding4Fun has featured my projects 6 times.

You've put it off because you really don't want to deal with SQL Server Full-Text Indexing - maybe it's not your cup of tea or maybe it's just intimidating or maybe you're not using something other than SQL Server. But there are alternatives to Full-Text Indexing that can be just as powerful and fairly simple. Solr is one such open source tool to help you with your application's searching needs. We'll take a look at the Solr project, how you can get it up and running very easily, how you can install it as a Windows Service (as opposed to a command window), and how you can use program against it RESTfully and using Solrnet.

And then somehow, you find yourself in the strange world of Node. What. Is. This. ? This talk is intended for .NET developers with basic node familiarity; we won't waste time on \"Hello, world\". Instead we'll explore patterns, libraries, and tools to make you more productive and comfortable in the node ecosystem; we'll also discuss ways to bridge the worlds of node and .NET so that you can leverage code you've already written. You'll walk out with practical guidance you can put to immediate use on your next node project.","links":[],"tags":[],"subjects":[],"resources":[],"prerequisites":[],"speakers":[{"profileImageUrl":"/img/speakers/default.png","slug":"josh-lane","firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Lane","fullName":"Josh Lane"}],"speakerNames":"Josh Lane","startDescription":"Saturday 12:30 PM"},{"slug":"sailsjs-a-high-productivity-nodejs-web-app-fr","title":"Sails.js: A High-Productivity Node.js Web App Framework","start":"\/Date(1405168200000)\/","end":"\/Date(1405172400000)\/","room":"409","description":"Node.js enables you to build fast, scalable applications in JavaScript.

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a pattern that helps you design your system to scale over time by taking messaging and applying it to commands your application issues and events that it raises.

The results have been remarkably positive: their processing capacity is currently over 800% of where they started, and they have the ability to scale even higher if necessary. In addition, their error rate has fallen by about 96%. However, alongside these successes are colossal new problems for the organization - specifically, the new highly-dispersed architecture represents a serious challenge for the barebones systems management team. This session will tell the story of this system-in-flux, and discuss ways to resolve the problems caused by the systemÒ‘s success. I will include a technical overview of the legacy system and the migration to the queue-based architecture. Specific attention will be given to assumptions in the legacy system that prevented scaling, and how these assumptions were addressed with message queues.
